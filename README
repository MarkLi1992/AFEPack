AFEPack is a C++ library for adaptive finite element programming.

AFEPack homepage: http://162.105.68.168/AFEPack

AFEPack has been tested on and works with:
 - Deal.II version 3.1
 - Redhat Linux 7.1, 7.3, 8.0

If anyone is interested in extending the library, feel free to contact
the author. Since there are no stable funding to support free software
development in China, the author has only very limited time on the 
maintainment of the package. Anyone who would like to help can contribute
on:
 - writing the document;
 - adding more template elements;
 - applying to some suitable problems;

If anyone applied the package on some interesting problems, the author
is very glad to get the information.

See COPYING for the full text of the license under which is this work
